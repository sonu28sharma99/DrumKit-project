# Hosted Project

## Things I learned:
1. JavaScript
3. DOM Manipulation
4. Control Structures
5. HTML Audio API
6. JavaScript CSS Manipulation
7. addEventListener

## Project Description/Summary:
The point of this project is to have each key, when pressed, make a corresponding drum noise. It also uses CSS transitions and animations to make the project more interactive to the user. I completed this project earlier in my JavaScript learning phase. I found it quite confusing because I had never used the HTML audio API or the selection of DOM elements using the date-key attribute.

## New Things Learned or Refreshed:
This project involved the use a “data-key” attribute that I'd never seen before. The “data-key” attribute was then selected using the CSS selector[attribute] method. I found this interesting as this was the first time I had saw this done. I also learned how to associate an audio file with the audio API.

### Time to Code:
This took about 30 minutes to code.

### Lines of Code:
This took about 103 lines of code in total, about 40 of which is JavaScript.

### Biggest Take Away(s):
Retrieving elements from the DOM is not limited to just “id”, “class”, and elements. You can also select DOM elements using the elements attributes.
